### Hi!  Welcome to my space on GitHub.
### I'm Nicky Dubs and I am a loopstation musician.  ðŸ‘‹
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring web+coding tools & attempting to learn new (automated?) ways to help me grow my music brand.  I use the Boss RC-505 loopstation, a Roland Octapad a Microkorg and an acoustic drum kit to shred over festival bass music.  I am primarily a drummer but I also have a deep passion for synth playing and singing when my voice allows. 
### 
### ðŸ˜„ I love using all my skills all at once to create captivating musical journeys for the fun & healing of it.  
### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with marketing + leveraging my Musical live streams and Youtube content such that I can pay my rent
### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything musical/computer related.
### ðŸ“« How to reach me: nickydubsmusic@gmail.com or else through my socials!
### âš¡ Fun fact: I once blew a 2 minute and 15 second long fart.  And I have a minute and forty second one on tape!  Knowing this, imagine how good my love songs are.
### k bye!
