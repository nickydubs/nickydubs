### Hi! 👋 ✨
### My name is ✨ _Nicky Dubs_ ✨, welcome to my space on GitHub?  ✨ ✨
### 🔭 I am experimenting with html/css/js code to create a musicians website from "scratch" 🔭
### 🔭 (using & frankensteining whatever open-source code/templates i find to be most useful). 🔭
### 🔭 As the experiment continues of building a site for my exact purposes, it should be quite easily forkable for other independent artists/performers/retailers. 🔭
### If you have ever done this before and had any successes/failures, please let me know!  Thank you so much!
