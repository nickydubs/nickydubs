<span style="font-size:9px; font-family:arial;">Hi! ðŸ‘‹ âœ¨
My name is âœ¨ _Nicky Dubs_ , welcome to my space on GitHub?  âœ¨ âœ¨
  <br>
I am experimenting with html/css/js code to create a musicians website from "scratch"
  <br> 
(using & frankensteining whatever open-source code/templates i find to be most useful). 
  <br>
As the experiment continues of building a site for my exact purposes, it should be quite easily forkable for other independent artists/performers/retailers. 
If you have ever done this before and had any successes/failures, please let me know!  Thank you so much! 
<br>
Tasks:
1. [beta] connecting social accounts in 1 main row/group<br>
2.        find/organize best wordpress-esque animations (paralax, fades, slides, glowpulses, more unique etc.)<br>
3.        organize code & **feng** **shui** of donations page<br>
4.        + online epk, updated bio + vids (one-click promo)<br>
5.        + merch store (taking donations/payments & distributing art/music/NFTs w/shipping etc.)<br>
6.        + 3rd-party app connectivity (songkick, soundcloud, youtube, insta etc.)<br>
7.        + trippy easter eggs?<br>
8.        + web3 smartcontract marketplace from scratch + algorithmic tools for marketing & daytrading strategy discovery.<br>
9.        any other ideas?  leave me a message!  whatever else I can think of. <br><br><br>
